# R Data Analysis Journey 🚀

This repository tracks my daily progress as I learn and practice data analysis using R. 

## 🗓️ Plan
- Week 1: R Foundations
- Week 2: Data Wrangling (`dplyr`, `tidyr`)
- Week 3: Data Visualization (`ggplot2`)
- Week 4: Applied Statistics & Modeling

## 📂 Structure
- `01-foundations/`: Basic syntax, data types
- `02-data-wrangling/`: Filtering, mutating, reshaping
- `03-visualization/`: Building plots with ggplot2
- `04-analysis-modeling/`: T-tests, regression, and model evaluation
- `projects/`: Complete mini-projects

## 📈 Goal
Become proficient in R for real-world data science and medical research!
